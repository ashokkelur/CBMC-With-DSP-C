Model checking</A>
</H2>
The test setup started with understanding Ericsson's build system, which is capable of handling large code base being maintained by large number of developers distributed across globe. The build system is complex to cater its requirements. The code base includes millions of lines of code and hundreds of developers working on it. For simplicity we started with small libraries which had little library dependency. Even with these libraries we did have to port most of the Ericsson specific Real Time OS APIs. Also we should note that these libraries were already tested and deployed in products.

<P>
With the modified CBMC, API stubbing/porting and understanding of build system, we were able process libraries of Ericsson. During the test run we observed a lot of false positives on assertions since these assertions were written to handle run time errors. This we mainly attribute to the fact that existing code is not written to provide information to static analysers. As we understood in chapter chap:background and chap:implementation, static analysers work by looking at information available in the existing logic without knowing run time information. To make the best of any static analyser one has to provide run time information statically. This information can be provided as part of header in each module or function, commented information for analysers or through contracts. The code we were working had contracts and next section provides more details on contract based verification.

<P>
The source code we used for the case study was LTE baseband controller software. The code was tested and deployed into products. The model checking process on 6 major modules took little over a month. Most of the time and effort was put to avoid false positives and state space explosion. The state space explosion is still a major issue in model checking. With millions of lines of code we quite often had to choose small bounding values.
